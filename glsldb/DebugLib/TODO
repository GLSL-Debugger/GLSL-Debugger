- streamRecording.h and streamRecording.c looks like hand-written but
  can be generated. There is ArgSizeFuncs.pl in generator/ which is
  probably template for this action. It must be checked and extended
  for full autogeneration.

- generator/Trampolines.pl - It some windows-specific thing, I think.
  Actually I don't care about it, but do some clean-ups and did not
  check it. Does it work?

- This trampolines thing needs to be integrated in cmake build. The
  information on how to do this is avaliable in VS projects in this folder.

- Also, all VS builds is broken now. It must be checked for broken
  paths and fixed.

- Optimisation. Debug lib takes too long to generate
